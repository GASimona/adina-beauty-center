                    most importantly, the Mother Creature. The mutants hatch from moving eggs at the top of the screen. Because
                    the Mother Creature replenishes eggs when they hatch or are destroyed, it must be defeated before the
                    player can advance to the next wave. If a mutant or a bomb thrown by a mutant comes into contact with
                    the cannon, the cannon will be destroyed and a reserve must be called up. A new cannon is awarded on
                    every other wave.</p>
